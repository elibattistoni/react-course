# Redux, side effects and asynchronous code

**IMPORTANT the reducer functions must be pure, without side effects, and synchronous; if it takes as input a certain value, it must produce always the same output**

But then: when working with Redux, when we dispatch some action that involves a side effect (e.g. HTTP request), where do we put the side effect code?
--> not in the reducer function!!
--> 2 possibilities:
        1) inside the components, e.g. with useEffect like we have done so far, and then we dispatch an action once the side effect is done, so Redux does not know anything about that side effect
        2) we write our own action creator functions, so we don't use those that are automatically generated by redux-toolkit: for these action creators, redux has a solution that allows us to perform side effects and run async tasks as a part of this action creators, without changing the reducer function, because that function must stay side effects free
