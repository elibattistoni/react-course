- the React code is in the src/ folder;
- in the starting material of the project we have 2 js and one css files
- IMPORTANT always: the **index.js** file is the first code file that will be executed when the page is loaded
- NB it is not exactly that code but a **transformed version of that code**: remember that our project setup involves some scripts that transform and optimize the code behind the scenes: we write the code in a easier-to-read developer-friendly way with some syntactic sugar, which makes our life as developer easier, but this code does not run like this in the browser (and especially not in all supported browsers): the **npm start** process will not just watch our code and then take it and deliver it to the browser, but before it delivers it, it will **transform** it so that certain extra features work in the browser (if you take this code and not transform it, it would not work). e.g. the code `import './index.css'` would not work if we used regular Javascript (**you cannot import css into JS**) same goes for the html code in JS
- in *package.json* in the dependencies there are 2 react libraries:
        "react": "^18.0.0"
        "react-dom": "^18.0.0"
    these two dependencies work together to form the React library
- see the files *index.js* and *App.js* for notes
- IMPORTANT BEST PRACTICE write new components in new files (this means that in a React project you will end up with dozens or hundreds of files because on React project you will have dozens or hundreds of Components -- but this is normal); to organize the files a bit, in the src/ folder add a components/ folder which will hold all the components source files (IMPORTANT we do not move App.js because it is a special Component in terms of its role in the application -- it is our **root component** i.e. the main Component being rendered in the starting file index.js) and all other components will be either nested inside of App.js or nested inside other components -- NB ultimately with React we build a **COMPONENT TREE**
- inside the /components folder add a new file named ExpenseItem.js (NB naming convention: first letter is uppercase + CamelCase)
- NB IMPORTANT how is a Component written in React? It is just a function: **a React Component is just a JavaScript function**, **a special kind of function because it returns JSX code, but it is just a JavaScript function**.
