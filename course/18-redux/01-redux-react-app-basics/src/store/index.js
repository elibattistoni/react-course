  //NB you MUST overwrite it: it is the best practice and an important rule when using Redux
  //NB IMPORTANT always overwrite it and return a brand new object

/*
% POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH REACT-REDUX
| 1) typos in action names
| 2) really really long redux files (because you have to always return all the properties of the state object)
| 3) easy to mess up and change the currentState when you have a really complex state object and a lot of data

| in the past there were solutions to these problems, like using named exports for the action types and creating multiple and smaller redux files
| but we don't need this anymore because we have the Redux Toolkit, which is a library that makes things really much easier
