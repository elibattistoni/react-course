  //# load movies immediately when the app is loaded with useEffect
  useEffect(() => {

  }, [fetchMoviesHandler]); //| we should add a pointer to fetchMoviesHandler as a dependency of this effect (the effect should be re-executed whent the function changes)
  //| and the fetchMoviesHandler could echance if we were using some external state (we are not doing it here, but we could)
  //| however, fetchMoviesHandler could change on every component re-render cycle because "it is a new object" therefore it is different
  //| so if we add if as a dependency we could create a infinite loop
  //| one solution could be to omit it, because in any case we are getting the result that we want
  //| however this could introduce subtle bugs if our function was using some external state
  //| so the best practice solution is to use useCallback to wrap the fetchMoviesHandler function with it
  //| so this works without an infinite loop, we can reload manually and when clicking the button
  //| so this is how we can leverage useEffect to make sure that we send an HTTP request immediately when a component loads and not just when a button is clicked
  //| importantly this can also be extended to send HTTP request when other things change
  //| and we also ensured that the HTTP request really runs when it needs to run but not when it does not need to run
