So far we have onlyu built single page applications in which the URL never changes (if we want to share the link, we can only link the same page).

In this section we will dive into a concept called "ROUTING", and we are going to learn how we can add multiple pages (or the illusion of having multiple pages) with different URLS to the same singel page application.

So, we will still build a single page application where React and the browser is responsible for updating what the user sees, but we will still be able to change the URL and use multiple pages.
