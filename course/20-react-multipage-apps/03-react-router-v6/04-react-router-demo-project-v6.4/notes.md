# React Router version 6.4
React Router 6.4 gives you some key features that simplify data fetching and data submission in your React apps.

This project is created with Vite instead of create-react-app 


These are the basic new features added by React Router version 6.4. It's all about data fetching and data submission and it's all about getting the related logic out of your components, and make your components leaner and instead, the goal is to put that logic in a simplified form into these extra action or loader functions. And it's a vastly simplified form because you don't have to worry about error handling and loading spinners or anything like that because React Router manages all these things for you as you saw over the last minutes. It's a different way of thinking about data fetching and data sending but ultimately, it allows you to write less code and leaner components. I like it a lot and I think it greatly simplifies the way of building complex React applications.

Advanced feature about v6.4 on fetching and sumbitting data: you can also defer loading data.
